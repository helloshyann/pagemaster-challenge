                                                man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.

                                                his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement 
                                                in Hobbiton. 
                                                Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever 
                                                since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his 
                                                travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, 
                                                that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, 
                                                there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. 
                                                Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; 
                                                but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was 
                                                too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well 
                                                as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. 
                                                &ldquoIt will have to be paid for,&rdquo; they said. &ldquoIt isn’t natural, and trouble will come of it!&rdquo;`;

                                            and the way Wendy knew was this.
                                            One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower 
                                            and ran with it to her mother.
                                            I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and 
                                            cried, “Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the 
                                            subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. 
                                            Two is the beginning of the end.`;
